# 📘 Assignment: Data Structures in Python

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to use and manipulate Python's built-in data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Practice creating, accessing, and modifying these structures through hands-on coding exercises.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ List Operations

#### Description
Write a Python program that demonstrates how to create a list, add elements, remove elements, and iterate through the list.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Create a list of at least 5 items
- Add and remove elements from the list
- Print all elements using a loop

### 🛠️ Dictionary Manipulation

#### Description
Create a dictionary to store key-value pairs, update values, add new pairs, and remove items.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Create a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs
- Update the value for one key
- Add a new key-value pair
- Remove a key-value pair
- Print the dictionary

### 🛠️ Set Usage

#### Description
Demonstrate how to use sets for storing unique items, adding/removing elements, and performing set operations (union, intersection).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Create two sets with some overlapping values
- Add and remove elements from a set
- Show the union and intersection of the sets
- Print the results

### 🛠️ Tuple Basics

#### Description
Show how to create and use tuples, including accessing elements and understanding immutability.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Create a tuple with at least 4 elements
- Access and print elements by index
- Attempt to modify a tuple and handle the error
