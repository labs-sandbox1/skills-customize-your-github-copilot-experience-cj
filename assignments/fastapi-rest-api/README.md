# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and deploy RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. Students will create endpoints, handle requests, and return JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Set Up FastAPI Project

#### Description
Set up a new FastAPI project and run a basic web server.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a main FastAPI app file
- Run the server locally and access the default route

### 🛠️ Task 2: Create API Endpoints

#### Description
Implement RESTful endpoints for a simple resource (e.g., books, users, or tasks).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Define at least two GET endpoints (e.g., list all items, get item by ID)
- Define a POST endpoint to add a new item
- Return JSON responses for all endpoints

### 🛠️ Task 3: Data Validation and Error Handling

#### Description
Add data validation using Pydantic models and handle errors gracefully.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Use Pydantic models for request and response data
- Validate incoming data for POST requests
- Return appropriate error messages for invalid requests

### 🛠️ Task 4: (Optional) Add Update and Delete Endpoints

#### Description
Extend your API to support updating and deleting resources.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Implement PUT or PATCH endpoint to update an item
- Implement DELETE endpoint to remove an item
- Ensure all changes are reflected in the API responses
